# 🧳 SAS Award Finder (Home Assistant Integration)

This custom integration fetches **award seat availability from SAS** (Scandinavian Airlines) and displays it as a sensor in Home Assistant.

You can add multiple sensors (e.g. OSL→LYR, OSL→EWR, etc.) — each fetching availability for the selected month.
